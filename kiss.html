				Every kiss is a little reminder that you are adored beyond words.<br />
				Sometimes, words feel too small to hold everything I feel for you, or<br />
				they just can't quite capture the depth of what’s in my heart. But
				when<br />
				we kiss, everything makes sense. It’s more than just affection; it’s
				a<br />
				quiet promise. It’s a moment where the rest of the world fades away,
				and<br />
				it’s just you and me. I want to spend today making sure you feel that<br />
				adoration. I want to kiss away your worries, celebrate your joys, and<br />
				remind you how incredibly special you are to me. You mean the
				absolute<br />
				world to me, and I hope you feel loved, cherished, and treasured—not<br />
				just today, but every single day. Thank you for being you.
